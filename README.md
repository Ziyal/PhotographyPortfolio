# Photography Portfolio

This project is a place for the photographer to promote themselves to clients and as a portfolio. Being a photographer myself, I created it as if I had my own photography business and all images were taken and edited by me, Sereina Blanchard. Being able to create a project with lots of images makes me really happy!

I wanted to create a project where I could do a lot of pretty front-end stuff with photos, and this fit the bill perfect. There was a lot of good practice making the whole page responsive, especially with all the images. I was able to create a neat hover effect for the photo categories on the home page. The navbar was good experience and practice making things responsive. In normal view it displays the links to the different sections, but if the screen is smaller it goes to a hamburger button. The contact form uses Formspree, which emails the contents to the selected email. Super easy and awesome. 

On the back end I have a Express server with a MongoDB database. It's there were I'm able to login, create and modify albums, add photos to the DB, and query for albums and photos.
